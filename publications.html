			<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Who Wrote Wuthering Heights?</strong></span></p>
			
			<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
			Emily Brontë published Wuthering Heights in 1847 under the pseudonym Ellis Bell. It was not until the later second edition, published after Emily’s death, that 
			she was credited as the novel’s author. Those Victorian attitudes towards women which compelled Brontë to publish as Bell have not been wholly eradicated, with 
			her legitimacy as the sole author being called into question by male commentators at several junctures since. Their claim is that Emily’s brother Branwell is 
			the real author of Wuthering Heights. Using stylometry, a computer-assisted technique which measures the likely author of a text, this brief experiment 
			demonstrates that it is highly unlikely that Branwell Brontë contributed to the writing of Wuthering Heights, and that Emily, as generally considered, is the 
			novel’s sole author. Furthermore, considering a number of limitations with the corpus being tested, this study provides a good and necessary example of 
			stylometry in practice, and how such an experiment should be conducted in less-than-ideal circumstances.</p>
