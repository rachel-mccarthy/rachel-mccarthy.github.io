<p>Rachel McCarthy is a PhD researcher at University College Cork, Ireland, where she previously earned a First Class Honours in her undergraduate degree in 'Digital Humanities and 
Information Technology'. Her Bachelor's thesis explored how the popularity of 19th century literature was impacted by the gender of the author using stylometry, collocation analysis and 
relative frequencies.</p>


<p>She then completed a master’s degree in 'Digital Text Analysis' at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, where she achieved a Distinction overall as well as a HOCI (highest possible 
grade) on her Master's thesis, recognizing her outstanding performance in investigating the stylistic identifiers of authorial gender by examining the novels of men, women, and women who
 published under male pen names over a 300-year period.</p>


<p>Rachel is currently a PhD reseracher at University College Cork as part of <a href="https://www.horizoncascade.net/" target="_blank">CASCADE</a>, a Horizon Europe 
<a href="https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/doctoral-networks" target="_blank">MSCA</a> and <a href="https://www.ukro.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UKRO</a> Doctoral 
Network. The PhD project, entitled <a href="https://www.horizoncascade.net/phd5/" target="">Measuring Change in Irish Literature</a>, will use techniques from cultural analytics and 
natural language processing to pursue questions about the centrality of subject matters to Ireland’s literary canon, authorial language and individual style through time. Passionate 
about advancing text analysis, Rachel aims to uncover new insights into literary and historical texts using digital methodologies.</p>
